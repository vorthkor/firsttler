My first flutter App.

## Getting Started

I made the app based on this excellent course:
[Curso de Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlBnICoI-g-d-J57QIz6Tx5xtUDGQdBFB)
- idiom: PT-BR

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
